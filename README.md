## ðŸ“š **Modules**

### Module 00: Getting Started with C++
- **Concepts Covered**:
  - Namespaces
  - Classes & Member Functions
  - `stdio` Streams
  - Initialization Lists
  - `static`, `const` Keywords
  - Basic C++ syntax and structure

This module introduces the foundational elements of C++ programming and sets the stage for more advanced topics. Learn about classes, object-oriented programming basics, and the power of initialization lists!

### Module 01: Understanding Memory and References
- **Concepts Covered**:
  - Memory Allocation
  - Pointers to Members
  - References
  - Switch Statements

Dive into memory management, explore pointers, and learn about references and their use in function arguments and switch-case control flow.

### Module 02: Polymorphism and Operator Overloading
- **Concepts Covered**:
  - Ad-hoc Polymorphism
  - Operator Overloading
  - Orthodox Canonical Class Form

Polymorphism allows for flexible function calls, and operator overloading provides intuitive syntax for custom types. Learn about the Orthodox Canonical Class Form to handle constructors, destructors, and copy behavior.

### Module 03: Object-Oriented Programming: Inheritance
- **Concepts Covered**:
  - Inheritance
  - Base and Derived Classes

Inheritance is a key concept in object-oriented programming. Learn how to create relationships between classes, enabling code reuse and flexibility.

### Module 04: Polymorphism in Depth: Abstract Classes and Interfaces
- **Concepts Covered**:
  - Subtype Polymorphism
  - Abstract Classes
  - Interfaces

This module dives deeper into polymorphism by exploring abstract classes and interfaces. Learn how to design flexible systems where classes implement common functionality through inheritance.

### Module 05: Loops and Exception Handling
- **Concepts Covered**:
  - Repetition (Loops)
  - Exception Handling (try-catch)

Master loops for repetitive tasks and discover how to handle exceptions, ensuring robust error management in your programs.

### Module 06: Mastering C++ Casting
- **Concepts Covered**:
  - Dynamic Cast
  - Static Cast
  - Const Cast
  - Reinterpret Cast

C++ casting allows you to convert between different types in a way that's safe and intentional. This module explores the different types of casting and their appropriate usage.

### Module 07: Templates and Generic Programming
- **Concepts Covered**:
  - Templates (Function and Class Templates)
  - Generic Programming

Learn how to write flexible, reusable code using templates. This module introduces the concept of generic programming, allowing functions and classes to operate on different data types.

### Module 08: Advanced Templates: Containers, Iterators, and Algorithms
- **Concepts Covered**:
  - Templated Containers (Vectors, Maps, etc.)
  - Iterators
  - Algorithms

Explore the power of the Standard Template Library (STL) and gain hands-on experience with templated containers, iterators, and algorithms that make your C++ code efficient and concise.

### Module 09: STL and Advanced Algorithms
- **Concepts Covered**:
  - Standard Template Library (STL)
  - Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)
  - Ford-Johnson Algorithm

Understand the rich set of data structures and algorithms available in the STL. Learn about Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) and how to implement the Ford-Johnson algorithm, an advanced sorting technique.
